libpv
=====

This is basically the stolen guts of edm's channel access process variable
implementation. I only had to comment out two references to edmDebug symbol
and make sure to be thread safe during inititalisation and when retrieving
the host (IOC) name.

Would be nice to share this code between future versions of edm and QCA, i.e.
to keep the interface clean ;-) Maybe the containers (Hash, ...) should be
done with STL (and/or Qt)?.

Edm's CALC pvs don't work reliably with QCA atm. And I have no idea what an
edm LOC pv is meant to be.

Would be nice to provide an API to create mighty "soft channels", e.g. sums
of linearely transformed EPICS channels and the like.
